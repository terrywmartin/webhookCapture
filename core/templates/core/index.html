               <p>Welcome to a tool I wish I had at my last job.  Seriously.  This would have been useful. But I didn't have the knowledge to build a tool like this 
               and the dev team was busy doing other things. I ended up building a simple API endpoint in Node.js and it met my needs.</p>

               <p>This purpose of this app is to simply capture webhooks, well, any JSON payload really, but my use case was to capture webhooks for troubleshooting purposes. </p>

               <p>The app itself is very simple.
               <ol>
                <li>
                  Create an account.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Create a unique endpoint.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Configure an application to send the webhook to the endpoint.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Watch the requests come in. 
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>Very simple.  The payloads are removed when you log out.</p>
