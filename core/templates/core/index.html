               <p>Introducing a tool I sorely needed in my previous role â€“ a tool that would have been incredibly useful. Unfortunately, lacking the expertise to build such a tool at the time and with the development team occupied elsewhere, I took matters into my own hands. I crafted a straightforward API endpoint using Node.js, tailored to meet my specific needs.</p>
               
               <p>The primary function of this app is to seamlessly capture webhooks, or any JSON payload for that matter. In my case, the tool proved invaluable for troubleshooting purposes, allowing me to efficiently collect and analyze webhooks for swift issue resolution.</p>
               
               <p>The app itself is very simple.
               <ol>
                <li>
                  Create an account.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Create a unique endpoint.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Configure an application to send the webhook to the endpoint.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Watch the requests come in. 
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>Very simple.  The payloads are removed when you log out.</p>
